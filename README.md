# PerfectTrails-DBMS
The objective of this case study is to provide Proof-of-Concept for creating a database of trails all over The United States of America into an industry ready model for end users who cannot find any conclusive sources of information about the adventure trails available around them. The business use case covered in our case study is to close the gap of unavailability of platform which serves as a single source of information for adventurous recreational activities. Perfect Trails is a user-friendly solution for the aforementioned business case that will allow users to browse, book and purchase cool merchandise of the trails they are interested in. Relational database is designed for Perfect Trails that will eliminate the redundancy of data in the system. If the user cancels his subscription, automatically all his information except past orders and bookings will be removed from data. Similarly, if a trail is deemed restricted for general public the data related to those trails will be automatically removed from the database. Not only this, generating statistics for user analytics or marketing or forecasting is also one of the features realizable with Perfect Trails.
